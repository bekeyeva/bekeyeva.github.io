                                Yurui has an arrogant personality as he looks down on Konohagakure shinobi and
                                boasts the superiority of Kumo.
                                He openly taunts those who he believes are inferior to him. He jumps to conclusions, calling Boruto weak,
                                even though he had not seen him fight and being the Hokage's son. He also appears to be rather controlling,
                                trying to remove Boruto and Sarada from their booth even though they were already sitting there. He admires Killer B.

                                Yurui has fair skin, blond hair and grey eyes. Just like Killer B, he also has a tattoo of a bull's horn on his left cheek
                                (which corresponds to Gyūki not having a left horn). His outfit consists of a standard Kumogakure flak jacket, complete with
                                a white Kumo forehead protector and baggy white pants. Additionally, he has bandages around his arms, extending to the back of
                                his hands. He also carries a pendant that has the head of Gyūki and two Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords on his back.

                                Yurui is described as an elite shinobi and a strategist who gives off a slovenly impression to throw his enemies off guard.
                                Using the bubblegum he's constantly chewing, he can shoot projectiles to entrap an opponent or create giant bubbles that are
                                capable of trapping an enemy inside or causing explosions. Due to carrying two Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords on his
                                back, it can be assumed that he is skilled in kenjutsu.
