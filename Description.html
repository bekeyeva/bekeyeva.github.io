                            The birthday of Naruto Uzumaki on the village called Konoha was attacked by the legendary demon,
                            Nine-tailed Fox. The fourth Hokage at the cost of his life saved the village,
                            sealing the demon in the newborn Naruto, unknowingly dooming him to a life of hatred of the villagers.
                            Despite the lack of talent in many areas of ninjutsu, restlessness and cockiness,
                            Naruto has a dream — to become Hokage, the strongest ninja in the village. Wanting
                            recognition, which did not receive, he works hard and trains with his team-mates,
                            Sasuke with Uchihas and Sakura Haruno and their mentor Kakashi, Hatake. He and his
                            partners will have to go through a lot on the way to their cherished places: battles,
                            love, friendship, betrayal, thirst for power...
